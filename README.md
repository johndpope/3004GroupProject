## Branches
- Make sure that with every new task you start, you create a branch off master for that work.

- When creating branches, use this format:
	- `{name}/{bugfix|improvement|new|docs}/name-of-branch`


## Pull Requests
- Make sure to tag your PR's with `bugfix`, `improvement`, `new`, or `docs`.
- Push weekly dev logs straight to master.
- Everyone should review every pull request
	- Put your ++ label on it when it's reviewed
- Do not merge until everyone has ++'d it


## Issues
- Use the `bug`, `task`, `feature`, `improvement`, and `docs` labels
- Please add all new issues to the proper `milestone` in GH, i.e. `Deliverable 1`
